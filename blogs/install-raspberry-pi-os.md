# Install Raspberry OS (64-bit) on a MicroSD card and use it to boot the Raspberry Pi

In this blog, I will install **Raspberry OS (64-bit)** on a **MicroSD card** and use it to boot the Raspberry Pi (RPi) SBC (operating in headless mode). Use RPi 3B or RPi 4B board with a MicroSD (8GB minimum or up to 32GB).

## Install Raspberry OS (64-bit) on a MicroSD card

Download [OS images](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) for RPi

## Boot the Raspberry Pi (RPi) SBC (operating in headless mode)

Insert microSD card to Raspberry Pi and boot it up. After that we are going to operate in headless mode with SSH. We need to use a computer with the same network as Raspberry Pi and use command `ssh [username]@[hostname]` and enter password
