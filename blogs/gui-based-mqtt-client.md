# GUI-based MQTT client to publish messages or subscribe to a topic

In this blog, I will show you how to use GUI-based MQTT client to publish messages or subscribe to a topic.

Examples of GUI-based MQTT Apps:
- [MQTT.fx](https://softblade.de/)
- [MQTT Explorer](https://github.com/thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer)
- [MQTTBox](https://github.com/workswithweb/MQTTBox)

I will use **MQTT Explorer** for this blog.

I will use "test.mosquitto.org" as a public MQTT broker which is already created when you open the program.  
Server "test.mosquitto.org" Port 1883 then click connect.
